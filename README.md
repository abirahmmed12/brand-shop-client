**Brand Selection and Product Pages**: Implement a feature that allows users to select a brand from the list of Food and Beverage brands. When a user selects a brand, they are redirected to a brand-specific page that displays products related to that brand. Each product should include details like the image, name, type (e.g., beverage, snack), price, rating, and buttons to view product details or update the product information.

**Product Details Page:** Create a detailed product page that displays comprehensive information about a selected product. Users should be able to view the product's image, name, type, price, rating, and other relevant details. Include an "Add to Cart" button on this page, allowing users to add the product to their cart. Implement a private/protected route for the product details page.

**User Cart:** Develop a "My Cart" page where users can view and manage the products they've added to their cart. Users should have the option to remove products from their cart. The design of this page is up to you, but it should be user-friendly and visually appealing. Implement a private/protected route for the cart page.

**Product Submission:** Create an "Add Product" page with a form that allows users to submit new products to the website. The form should include fields for uploading an image, providing product details (name, type, price, short description, rating), and a button to add the product to the website's database. Ensure that this is a private/protected route.

**Authentication and User Management:** Implement email and password-based authentication for user registration and login. Users should be able to toggle between the registration and login views. Display error messages when password requirements are not met during registration or when login credentials don't match. Additionally, provide at least one extra login method, such as social media (e.g., Google, Facebook, or GitHub) authentication. Once a user is logged in, display their username and profile picture in the navbar and include a logout button for easy session management.
